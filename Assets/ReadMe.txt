These assets can be placed into your scene as is. 
The Start position should fall slightly inside the car model and the particles should protrude out to avoid any sudden particle spawning. 
Attach these to scripts to turn on and off and play as you need. e.g. Backfure during gear change, smoke during skids etc.
